## What is Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon?
 
Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon is a spin-off of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, a metroidvania game that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter and released in 2019. Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon was developed by Inti Creates, a Japanese studio that specializes in retro-style games. It was offered as a bonus reward for backers of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, but it was also released separately for anyone to buy.
 
The game is set in the same universe as Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, but it takes place in an earlier time period. The game follows Zangetsu, a demon hunter who seeks revenge against the alchemist who cursed him with a demonic arm. Along his journey, he meets three other characters who can join him as allies: Miriam, a shardbinder who can use magic crystals; Alfred, an alchemist who can cast spells; and Gebel, another shardbinder who can transform into a bat. Each character has their own abilities and playstyles, and the player can switch between them at any time.
 
The game has eight stages that can be completed in different orders and with different outcomes depending on the player's choices. The game also has multiple endings and modes that add replay value and challenge. The game's graphics, music, and gameplay are heavily inspired by the Castlevania games from the NES era, especially Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. The game is a tribute to the fans of the genre and a love letter to the classics.
  
## Why do some license keys not work?
 
Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon was released digitally on various platforms, such as Steam, PlayStation Store, Xbox Live, Nintendo eShop, and 3DS eShop. Each platform has its own system for generating and verifying license keys for digital games. A license key is a unique code that allows the user to download and play the game on their device.
 
However, some license keys for Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon were faulty or corrupted due to a technical error. This error affected a small percentage of users who bought or received the game on certain platforms. Some users reported that their license keys were invalid or already used by someone else. Others reported that their license keys worked at first but stopped working after a while. This prevented them from playing the game or accessing some features, such as online leaderboards or achievements.
 
The developers of Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon apologized for this inconvenience and assured the users that they were working on fixing the problem as soon as possible. They also offered to replace any faulty license keys with new ones for free. They asked the users to contact them through their official website and provide proof of purchase and their original license key. They also advised the users not to share their license keys with anyone else or post them online, as this could compromise their security and privacy.
